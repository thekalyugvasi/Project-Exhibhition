# Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV and CVZone

This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and the CVZone library in Python. The application detects hand gestures from a live video feed and classifies them into predefined categories using a trained neural network model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- CVZone (installation instructions: [CVZone GitHub](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone))
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (for loading the pre-trained neural network model)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thekalyugvasu/Project-Exhibhition.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained neural network model (`keras_model.h5`) and labels (`labels.txt`) from the [CVZone GitHub](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone) repository.

4. Place the downloaded model and labels files in the `Model` directory of the cloned repository.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. The application will open a live video feed from your webcam. Hold your hand in front of the camera to perform gestures.

3. The recognized gestures will be displayed in the video feed along with the corresponding labels.

4. Press `Esc` to exit the application.

## Customization

- You can customize the recognized gestures and their corresponding labels by modifying the `labels` list in the Python script.

- Adjust the `offset`, `imgSize`, and other parameters in the script to optimize hand detection and gesture recognition for your setup.

## Acknowledgments

- The hand detection and tracking functionality in this project is implemented using the CVZone library, developed by Abhishek Thakur. Check out the [CVZone GitHub](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone) repository for more information and updates.

- The pre-trained neural network model used for gesture classification is provided by the CVZone library.
